## Project Description
StudyBuddy is a WhatchOS app for Apple Watches which aims to help students develop better studying habits and avoid falling into the usual problems experienced by students such as missing meals, lacking sleep and overworking themselves. All of which decrease the quality of the information that our brain is capable of retaining and cause students to loose motivation. We hope to help students by timing their study sessions, keep track of their tasks and provide them with motivational quotes to keep going.
