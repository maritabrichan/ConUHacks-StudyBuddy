## Project Description
StudyBuddy is a WhatchOS app for Apple Watches which aims to help students develop better studying habits and avoid falling into the usual problems experienced by students such as missing meals, lacking sleep and overworking themselves. All of which decrease the quality of the information that our brain is capable of retaining and cause students to loose motivation. We hope to help students by timing their study sessions, keep track of their tasks and provide them with motivational quotes to keep going.

## Inspiration
There exists many study companion apps on phones, the very device people are trying to avoid while studying! In accordance with the nventive competition criteria to build a smart watch application, we decided to build an app that will benefit our own and other students study habits.

## What it does
The study timer app includes a Pomodoro timer (25 mins) a success message, and a task management system which counts the number of study sessions you have left.

## How we built it
We built this program with Swift and Xcode. We used GitHub as our version control system and Figma to help with design ideas for the user interface.

## Challenges we ran into
This was all of our first time using Swift/WatchOS and creating an IOS or watch app in general. This required us to do a fair bit of preliminary research, meaning that we only started coding substantial aspects of the app 10 hours before the deadline. With this being said, working with WatchOS was fairly simple because of its extensive documentation.
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
From knowing nothing about apple watch app development to building a working Pomodoro study timer, our team was proud to learn the fundamentals of developing code for WatchOS.

## What we learned
Since this was the first hackathon for some of us, we learned how to work together in a team under stress as well as how to develop an smart watch app. We learned the basics of both WearOS (for Android) and WatchOS (for Apple)

## What's next for CODEBSTRZ Study Smart Watch App
There are many features which we did not have the time to add but are interested in continuing with in the project. For example, creating a database where we can track the user's time spent studying can add an incentive to study for long periods of time. We also had the idea of adding motivational messages and hints to take a break when users have been completing several Pomodoros in a row.
